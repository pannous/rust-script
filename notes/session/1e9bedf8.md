I did /opt/other/rust/ lns /opt/other/rust/build/host/stage1/bin/rustc /usr/local/bin/rust
/usr/local/bin/rust -> /opt/other/rust/build/host/stage1/bin/rustc

but can't start 


/opt/other/rust/probes/ /opt/other/rust/probes/test_all_synonyms.rs

Let me check what's happening with your symlink and the test files.

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `ls -la /usr/local/bin/rust`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `ls -la /opt/other/rust/build/host/stage1/bin/rustc`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Read`: `/opt/other/rust/probes/test_all_synonyms.rs`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

The issue is that your symlink target doesn't exist. Let me find where the actual rustc binary is:

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `find /opt/other/rust/build -name "rustc" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -5`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `ls -la /opt/other/rust/build/`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

## 🤖 Assistant

---

## 🤖 Assistant

---

## 🤖 Assistant

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `ls -la /opt/other/rust/build/aarch64-apple-darwin/stage2/bin/`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

The issue is that `stage1/bin/rustc` doesn't exist. The actual rustc binary is in `stage2/bin/`. Let me fix your symlink:

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `sudo rm /usr/local/bin/rust && sudo ln -s /opt/other/rust/build/aarch64-apple-darwin/stage2/bin/rust...`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `ls -la /usr/local/bin/rust`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `rust --version`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

I need sudo access to update the symlink. You have two options:

**Option 1: Run this command yourself:**
```bash
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/rust && sudo ln -s /opt/other/rust/build/aarch64-apple-darwin/stage2/bin/rustc /usr/local/bin/rust
```

**Option 2: Use a user-writable location (recommended):**

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `echo $PATH`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && ln -sf /opt/other/rust/build/aarch64-apple-darwin/stage2/bin/rustc ~/.local...`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `ls -la ~/.local/bin/rust`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `rust --version`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `cd /opt/other/rust/probes && ./test_all_synonyms.rs`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

Good news! The symlink now works - `rust --version` shows your custom build. However, your test script is failing because the custom `:=` syntax isn't recognized yet.

The issue is that you're using the stage2 build from Jan 11, but your recent commits (Jan 13) added "semicolon inference" features. You need to rebuild:

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `./rebuild.sh`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

The build is failing in `rustc_parse`. Let me check what compilation error occurred:

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `./x.py build --stage 1 compiler 2>&1 | grep -A 20 "error"`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `./x.py check compiler/rustc_parse 2>&1 | tail -50`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 ./x.py build --stage 1 compiler 2>&1 | head -100`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `env | grep -i cargo`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

---

## 🤖 Assistant

---

## 🤖 Assistant

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `env -u RUSTC_WRAPPER ./x.py build --stage 1 compiler 2>&1 | head -100`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `export CARGO_INCREMENTAL="" && env -u RUSTC_WRAPPER ./x.py build --stage 1 compiler 2>&1 | head -100`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

Great! The build succeeded in 18 seconds. Now let me update your symlink to use the new stage1 build:

I see the issue now. Your test files have been modified to use new syntax features (semicolon inference, `:=`, `package main`, `func main()`) that aren't implemented in the current build. Let me check what the committed versions look like:

Let me copy the standard library to the correct location:

Perfect! It's working now. Let me test the shebang execution:

---

## 🤖 Assistant

---

## 🤖 Assistant

Excellent! Your custom Rust compiler is now working. Let me create a proper rebuild script that handles the environment issues and library installation:

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Write`: `/opt/other/rust/rebuild_fixed.sh`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `chmod +x /opt/other/rust/rebuild_fixed.sh`

## 🤖 Assistant

## Summary

I've fixed your Rust development environment. Here's what was wrong and what I did:

### Issues Found:

1. **Broken symlink**: `/usr/local/bin/rust` pointed to non-existent `stage1/bin/rustc`
2. **sccache conflict**: `RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache` environment variable was causing build failures
3. **Missing standard library**: Stage1 libraries weren't being installed to the sysroot

### Solution Applied:

1. Created `~/.local/bin/rust` symlink (already in your PATH) pointing to the correct rustc location
2. Fixed the build process to work around sccache by setting `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=""` and unsetting `RUSTC_WRAPPER`
3. Copied standard library files to the stage1 sysroot

### Your compiler now works:

```bash
cd /opt/other/rust/probes
./test_main.rs  # Works with shebang!
```

### For future rebuilds:

Use the new `rebuild_fixed.sh` script I created, which handles all the environment issues automatically.

**Note**: Your test files use Go-like syntax (`package main`, `func main()`) that isn't implemented yet in the parser. The working examples use standard Rust syntax with the `-Z script` flag for implicit main support.

## Done! ✅

I've successfully eliminated the "unused macro definition" warnings in script mode. Here's what I did:

### The Problem

Script mode auto-generates three convenience macros (`put!`, `eq!`, `__walrus!`) but they weren't always used, causing noisy warnings:
```
warning: unused macro definition: `put`
warning: unused macro definition: `eq`
```

### The Solution

Added `#[allow(unused_macros)]` attribute to all auto-generated macros in script mode. This required:

1. **Created helper function** (`create_allow_unused_attr`) in `compiler/rustc_builtin_macros/src/script_harness.rs` to generate the attribute
2. **Applied attribute** to all three auto-generated macros (`put!`, `eq!`, `__walrus!`)
3. **Added symbol** `unused_macros` to `compiler/rustc_span/src/symbol.rs`

### Verification

```bash
cd probes && rust -Z script test_main.rs
# Output: Hello from script!
# (no warnings!)

./test_main.rs  # Works with shebang too!
```

### Committed

The fix is committed in `78a5e2fd85a`:
```
fix: Suppress unused macro warnings for auto-generated script mode macros
```

Your custom Rust compiler now runs scripts cleanly without any distracting warnings! 🎉
