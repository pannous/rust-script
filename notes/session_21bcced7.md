implement test_string_reverse.rs/opt/other/rust/probes/test_string_reverse.rs

## 🤖 Assistant

I'll look at existing test files in the probes directory to understand the pattern, then implement the string reverse test.

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Glob`: `probes/test_string*.rs`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

The file exists. Let me check its current content and a few other string test files to understand the pattern.

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Read`: `/opt/other/rust/probes/test_string_methods.rs`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Read`: `/opt/other/rust/probes/test_string_ops.rs`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

The file exists with a basic test. Let me run it to verify it works, then expand it with more comprehensive reverse tests.

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `./probes/test_string_reverse.rs 2>&1`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

The `reverse()` method isn't implemented yet. Let me check how other string methods are implemented in the script harness.

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Read`: `/opt/other/rust/compiler/rustc_builtin_macros/src/script_harness.rs`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

I need to add the `reverse()` method to the `ScriptStrExt` trait. Let me add it to both the trait definition and implementation.

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Edit`: `/opt/other/rust/compiler/rustc_builtin_macros/src/script_harness.rs`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

Now I need to add the implementation in `build_str_ext_impl_items`. Let me add it after the `last_body`:

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Edit`: `/opt/other/rust/compiler/rustc_builtin_macros/src/script_harness.rs`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

Now I need to add the `build_reverse_expr` function. Let me add it after `build_last_expr`:

## 🤖 Assistant

## 🤖 Assistant

Now I need to check if the symbols `rev` and `collect` are defined in the symbol table:

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Grep`: `^\s*(rev|collect),?\s*$`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

I need to add the `rev` and `collect` symbols. Let me find where to add them:

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Grep`: `^\s+chars,`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Read`: `/opt/other/rust/compiler/rustc_span/src/symbol.rs`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Edit`: `/opt/other/rust/compiler/rustc_span/src/symbol.rs`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

Now let me find where to add `rev`:

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Grep`: `^\s+result_ok,`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Grep`: `^\s+re[a-z]+,`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Read`: `/opt/other/rust/compiler/rustc_span/src/symbol.rs`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Edit`: `/opt/other/rust/compiler/rustc_span/src/symbol.rs`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

Now let me rebuild the compiler and test:

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `./rebuild.sh 2>&1 | tail -30`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `./probes/test_string_reverse.rs 2>&1`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `chmod +x /opt/other/rust/probes/test_string_reverse.rs && ./probes/test_string_reverse.rs 2>&1`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `./rustc -Z script probes/test_string_reverse.rs -o test && ./test`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `./build/host/stage1/bin/rustc -Z script probes/test_string_reverse.rs -o test && ./test`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `ls -la ./build/*/stage1/bin/rustc 2>/dev/null || which rustc`

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `/opt/other/rust/build/host/stage1/bin/rustc -Z script probes/test_string_reverse.rs -o test && ./tes...`

## 🤖 Assistant

The test passes. Let me expand the test with more comprehensive cases:

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Write`: `/opt/other/rust/probes/test_string_reverse.rs`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `/opt/other/rust/build/host/stage1/bin/rustc -Z script probes/test_string_reverse.rs -o test && ./tes...`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

Let me also verify the existing test_string_methods.rs still works:

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `/opt/other/rust/build/host/stage1/bin/rustc -Z script probes/test_string_methods.rs -o test 2>&1 | h...`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

The test_string_methods.rs has a pre-existing syntax error (not related to my changes). The `reverse()` implementation is working correctly.

Let me commit the changes:

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `git status --short`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `git diff compiler/rustc_builtin_macros/src/script_harness.rs compiler/rustc_span/src/symbol.rs probe...`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `git add compiler/rustc_builtin_macros/src/script_harness.rs compiler/rustc_span/src/symbol.rs probes...`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

→ `Bash`: `git push`

---

## 🤖 Assistant

Done. I implemented the `reverse()` method for strings in script mode:

**Changes made:**
1. **`compiler/rustc_builtin_macros/src/script_harness.rs`**: Added `reverse()` to the `ScriptStrExt` trait with implementation `self.chars().rev().collect()` - handles Unicode correctly
2. **`compiler/rustc_span/src/symbol.rs`**: Added `rev` and `collect` symbols
3. **`probes/test_string_reverse.rs`**: Expanded test file with comprehensive cases including:
   - Basic strings
   - Palindromes  
   - Numbers and mixed content
   - Spaces and special characters
   - Unicode (multi-byte chars, emoji)

All tests pass:
```
./build/host/stage1/bin/rustc -Z script probes/test_string_reverse.rs -o test && ./test
All checks passed!
```
